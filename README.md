#Week 1 – Engineering Concepts: Data Structures, Algorithms & Design Patterns

Overview

This week includes practical implementation of two critical modules:

Module 1: Data Structures & Algorithms – Real-world problems like inventory and task management

Module 2: Design Patterns & Principles – Application architecture patterns like Singleton, Factory, MVC, etc.

Each Java exercise includes source code with time complexity analysis, test files, and explanatory documentation. A structured PDF analysis file is also attached.

Contents

InventorySearchAnalysis.java – All 7 DSA problems with methods, tests, and complexity breakdowns

DesignPatterns.java – Covers 11 classic design patterns with example usage

Algorithms_Data Structures.pdf – Instructor-provided Week 1 reference guide for DSA

Design Patterns and Principles.pdf – Official exercise guide for design patterns (Week 1 continued)

DSA_Analysis_Section.md/pdf – Ready-to-insert analysis for DSA problems

🔍 Exercises Implemented

📘 Module A: Data Structures & Algorithms (From Algorithms_Data Structures.docx)

Inventory Management System – CRUD operations using HashMap

E-commerce Search – linearSearch vs binarySearch comparison

Sorting Customer Orders – BubbleSort and QuickSort with price

Employee Management – Array operations with time analysis

Task Management – Linked List-based dynamic structure

Library Search – Book lookup with linear/binary search

Financial Forecasting – Recursion with memoization for growth

📗 Module B: Design Patterns & Principles (From Design Patterns and Principles.docx)

Singleton Pattern

Factory Method Pattern

Builder Pattern

Adapter Pattern

Decorator Pattern

Proxy Pattern

Observer Pattern

Strategy Pattern

Command Pattern

MVC Pattern

Dependency Injection Pattern

Each pattern has a real-world-inspired scenario and Java implementation for easier understanding.

⚙️ How to Run

To run a file:

javac InventorySearchAnalysis.java
java Forecast   # or InventoryTest, etc.

Make sure only one main() class runs at a time, or split into separate files.

✅ Submission Notes

Both modules above are part of Week 1: Engineering Concepts.

PDF guides and .java files are aligned with assignment steps.

Use README.md and DSA_Analysis_Section as your project submission templates.
