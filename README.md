# 🧠 **WEEK 1 – ENGINEERING CONCEPTS**

## 📚 **Data Structures, Algorithms & Design Patterns**

### 📌 Overview

This week includes practical implementation of two critical modules:

* **Module 1**: Data Structures & Algorithms – Real-world problems like inventory and task management
* **Module 2**: Design Patterns & Principles – Application architecture patterns like Singleton, Factory, MVC, etc.

Each Java exercise includes source code with time complexity analysis, test files, and explanatory documentation. A structured PDF analysis file is also attached.

### 📁 Contents

* `InventorySearchAnalysis.java` – All 7 DSA problems with methods, tests, and complexity breakdowns
* `DesignPatterns.java` – Covers 11 classic design patterns with example usage
* `Algorithms_Data Structures.pdf` – Instructor-provided Week 1 reference guide for DSA
* `Design Patterns and Principles.pdf` – Official exercise guide for design patterns (Week 1 continued)
* `DSA_Analysis_Section.md/pdf` – Ready-to-insert analysis for DSA problems

### 🔍 Exercises Implemented

#### 📘 Module A: Data Structures & Algorithms (From Algorithms\_Data Structures.docx)

1. **Inventory Management System** – CRUD operations using `HashMap`
2. **E-commerce Search** – `linearSearch` vs `binarySearch` comparison
3. **Sorting Customer Orders** – `BubbleSort` and `QuickSort` with price
4. **Employee Management** – Array operations with time analysis
5. **Task Management** – Linked List-based dynamic structure
6. **Library Search** – Book lookup with linear/binary search
7. **Financial Forecasting** – Recursion with memoization for growth

#### 📗 Module B: Design Patterns & Principles (From Design Patterns and Principles.docx)

1. Singleton Pattern
2. Factory Method Pattern
3. Builder Pattern
4. Adapter Pattern
5. Decorator Pattern
6. Proxy Pattern
7. Observer Pattern
8. Strategy Pattern
9. Command Pattern
10. MVC Pattern
11. Dependency Injection Pattern

Each pattern has a real-world-inspired scenario and Java implementation for easier understanding.

### ⚙️ How to Run

To run a file:

```bash
javac InventorySearchAnalysis.java
java Forecast   # or InventoryTest, etc.
```

Make sure only one `main()` class runs at a time, or split into separate files.

### ✅ Submission Notes

* Both modules above are part of **Week 1: Engineering Concepts**.
* PDF guides and `.java` files are aligned with assignment steps.
* Use `README.md` and `DSA_Analysis_Section` as your project submission templates.
